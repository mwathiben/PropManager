# Phase-31 Onboarding Runbook

Operator-facing reference for the Phase-31 ONBOARDING surface: wizard
resume, activation funnel telemetry, prospect sample data, contextual
help drawer, empty-state checklists.

## Activation funnel (6 milestones)

Per landlord, recorded write-once in `onboarding_milestones`:

| Order | Milestone | Trigger |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| 1 | `signed_up` | UserObserver on landlord row insert/role-set |
| 2 | `first_property` | PropertyObserver on first row |
| 3 | `first_unit` | UnitObserver on first row |
| 4 | `first_tenant` | UserObserver on tenant role-set |
| 5 | `first_invoice` | InvoiceObserver on first row |
| 6 | `first_payment` | PaymentObserver on first row |

The recorder (`OnboardingMilestoneRecorder::record`) is idempotent —
duplicate calls return the existing row without firing a second
`MilestoneRecorded` event.

## Crons

| Command | Cadence (Africa/Nairobi) | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `onboarding-wizard:audit` | 04:45 daily | Buckets stalled wizard users by days inactive (1-3, 4-7, 8-30, 30+); emits `onboarding_stalled_count{bucket=X}`. |
| `activation:audit` | 04:15 daily | Emits `activation_signups_count{period}`, `activation_milestone_count{milestone, period}`, `activation_time_to_first_invoice_p50_hours`, `..._p90_hours`. |

## Endpoints (web routes)

- `GET  /onboarding` — wizard entry (redirects to current step or dashboard if complete)
- `POST /onboarding/step/{n}/skip` — skip optional step (records in `skipped_steps`)
- `GET  /api/onboarding/status` — JSON for the dashboard ResumeBanner
- `POST /onboarding/sample-data/populate` — load prospect demo dataset
- `POST /onboarding/sample-data/reset` — undo a previous populate
- `GET  /api/help/contextual?key=X` — per-page articles (HelpDrawer)
- `GET  /api/help/search?q=X` — full-text search (debounced from drawer)
- `GET  /api/onboarding/milestones` — flat boolean map for EmptyState checklist
- `POST /api/onboarding/checklist/dismiss` — landlord dismisses the checklist

## Tables

- `onboarding_milestones`     — write-once funnel ledger (unique landlord+milestone)
- `sample_data_runs`          — sample-data populate log (status machine + row_refs)
- `help_articles.help_key`    — per-route key column for contextual lookup
- `users.onboarding_checklist_dismissed_at` — per-user dismiss flag

## How to investigate

1. **7-day activation rate drops**: check `activation_time_to_first_invoice_p50_hours`. If it climbs, walk `onboarding_milestones` for landlords with `signed_up` but no `first_invoice` within 7 days — file content/UX issue.
2. **Wizard stalls spike**: `onboarding_stalled_count{bucket=8-30}` climbing means the resume banner / step layout has a friction point. Look at `onboarding_progress.current_step` distribution for the stalled cohort.
3. **Sample data not loading for a prospect**: `populate()` refuses when there is any `is_active=true` Lease for the landlord. Have them reset first OR remove the test lease — `reset()` undoes a prior populated run cleanly.
4. **Help drawer empty on a page**: that page is missing a `helpKey` constant — wire `window.__helpKey = 'page.routename.action'` in the Inertia page setup AND seed at least one `help_articles` row with `help_key` matching.

## CI gates
- Phase31OnboardingSurfaceTest — every cron is scheduled, every event has a listener, en/sw onboarding.php key sets match
- Phase31WizardTest — skip/last_touched_at semantics + status endpoint
- Phase31MilestoneTest — recorder idempotency, full funnel records, audit runs
- Phase31SampleDataTest — populate/reset + isolation + role gates
- Phase31HelpDrawerTest — contextual + search + role scoping + auth gate

## Deferrals

None for Phase 31. Sub-scope (NOT PRD findings) deferrals: Lighthouse audit for the new HelpDrawer focus-trap, manual NVDA pass on the ResumeBanner — both fold into the next a11y consolidation cycle.

# Phase-46 ONBOARDING-CANONICAL extensions (2026-05-17)

Phase 46 deepens the onboarding surface with a Mirror Registry, an OnboardingFlow value object, a signed-URL resume contract, and a stalled-session nudge cron. The Phase 31 funnel + resume banner stays intact — these are net-new infrastructure on top.

## Mirror Registry (CANONICAL-AUDIT)

`config('onboarding.mirrors')` declares every `users.*` column that denormalises a child-table record. Each entry has `column`, `canonical`, `key`, optional `canonical_filter`, optional `role_scope`, and `pinned` (sev3 at drift > 0 if true; sev4 at threshold 5/24h otherwise).

### Current entries

| Mirror | Canonical | Listener | Pinned |
|--------|-----------|----------|--------|
| `users.profile_photo_path` | `landlord_profiles.profile_photo_path` | `LandlordProfile::booted()` (saved) | yes |
| `users.emergency_contact_name` | `emergency_contacts.name` (is_primary) | `EmergencyContact::booted()` (saved) | yes |
| `users.emergency_contact_phone` | `emergency_contacts.phone` (is_primary) | `EmergencyContact::booted()` (saved) | yes |

### `mirror_exempt` (deprecation allow-list)

| Mirror | Deprecated | Remove by | Reason |
|--------|------------|-----------|--------|
| `users.kyc_completed_at` | 2026-05-17 | 2026-08-17 | Write-only ghost column — `User::hasCompletedKyc()` reads dynamically. Use `User::kycVerifiedAt()` (read-through accessor returning `MAX(reviewed_at)` from approved `tenant_kyc_submissions`) for the timestamp display. |

### Adding a new mirror

1. Declare the entry in `config('onboarding.mirrors')`.
2. Implement the saving listener on the canonical model — `Model::booted()` `static::saved` fans the canonical value into the user row.
3. Backfill via a migration block — walk every canonical row + write the mirror.
4. Verify with `php artisan onboarding:dedupe-audit` — the new entry should report `drift_count = 0`.

### Mirror-drift incident response

`onboarding:dedupe-audit` cron runs daily 03:30 Africa/Nairobi. When `canonical_mirror_drift_count{mirror=...}` > 0 fires:

1. `php artisan onboarding:dedupe-audit --verbose-rows` — see affected user_ids.
2. Inspect the listener on the canonical model.
3. Common causes: listener removed in refactor; `Model::query()->update()` bypassing the `saved` event; schema change broke the column reference.
4. Ship the listener fix + a one-off backfill block in the same CL.

## Wizard infrastructure (WIZARD-INFRA)

### onboarding_sessions

Per-user wizard state. **Not** unique on user_id — a user accumulates historical rows; `OnboardingSession::firstFor($user)` returns the live (`completed_at NULL AND abandoned_at NULL`) row or mints a fresh one.

Shape: `current_step`, `step_history` JSON (each entry `{step, action: advance|back|completed|abandoned|auto_abandoned, at}`), `started_at`, `last_touched_at`, `completed_at`, `abandoned_at`, `last_nudge_sent_at`.

The old `onboarding_progress.step_data` JSON blob stays in deprecation but is no longer the source of truth. Phase 47 [WIZARD-MIGRATE] will move step writes from the JSON blob to canonical-model service calls.

### OnboardingFlow value object

`App\Onboarding\OnboardingFlow::forRole($role)` returns a per-role step sequence:

- **landlord** — 8 steps (Welcome, Profile, First property, Units + building, Payment configuration, Invite team, First tenant, Done)
- **caretaker** — 3 steps (Profile, Building assignment, Notification preferences)
- **tenant** — 3 steps (Profile, KYC verification, Payment method)

### OnboardingSessionService

`advance(session, target, writer)` wraps the caller's canonical write closure in `DB::transaction` — a writer that throws does NOT advance the session.

`back(session, target)` NEVER touches canonical models — by explicit design (WIZARD-INFRA-3). The user can re-edit the previous step's form, but canonical rows don't roll back. step_history records `action='back'`.

`complete(session)` sets `completed_at = now()`. `markAbandoned(session)` sets `abandoned_at = now()`.

## Role dispatch (ROLE-PATHS)

`RegisteredUserController::store` accepts `role in ['landlord','caretaker','tenant']` (nullable, defaults to `tenant`). If `invitation_token` is supplied + the invitation is unaccepted, the **invitation's role overrides** the form choice (prevents privilege escalation). On signup, dispatches `OnboardingSession::firstFor($user)` so the wizard is ready on first dashboard hit.

Onboarding routes carry `verified` middleware — landlords must click the email verification link before reaching the wizard.

Invitations: `invitations.role` defaults to `caretaker` (historical semantic — tenant invitations live in `tenant_invitations`).

## Signed-URL resume (PROGRESS-RESUME)

### Generation

`OnboardingResumeService::generate(OnboardingSession): string` issues a Laravel `temporarySignedRoute` (`EXPIRY_DAYS=7`) keyed on the session id. Persists an `onboarding_resume_links` audit row with `SHA-256(signature)` — replay defence doesn't need to deserialise the URL.

### Consume

`consume(session, signature, ip)` throws `ValidationException` for:
- Unknown signature (no audit row)
- Replay (audit row already `consumed_at NOT NULL`)
- Expired (audit row `signed_until` < now())

Route `/onboarding/resume/{session}` middleware `signed` (Laravel's built-in URL-tamper check) + `OnboardingResumeRedirectController` (calls `consume()`, asserts owner, redirects to the session's `current_step`).

### Nudge cron

`onboarding:nudge-stalled` daily 09:00 Africa/Nairobi:

1. **Nudge**: sessions with `last_touched_at < today-3-days` AND `last_nudge_sent_at NULL OR < now-24h` — generate signed URL via `OnboardingResumeService::generate`; write `last_nudge_sent_at = now()`. Mail dispatch deferred to Phase 47 [WIZARD-MIGRATE] — current implementation logs the URL to laravel.log.
2. **Seal**: sessions with `last_touched_at < today-30-days` — flip `abandoned_at = now()` + append `step_history{action: 'auto_abandoned'}`.

Emits `onboarding_session_abandoned_count` gauge (sealed in the last 7 days; growth signal, sev4).

## Phase-46 troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Mirror-drift alert fires | Saving listener regressed | Inspect canonical model `booted()`; ship listener fix + one-off backfill |
| Tenant edits profile but landlord sees stale data | New `users.*` mirror without a listener | Add to `config('onboarding.mirrors')` + listener + backfill |
| Landlord signup fails "role is invalid" | Form submitted an unexpected role value | Verify Register.vue role dropdown only offers landlord/caretaker/tenant |
| Resume link returns 403 | Replay — link already consumed | Re-issue a fresh URL via the cron (next 24h tick) |
| Nudge email queued but not delivered | Queue worker stopped | Check `php artisan queue:failed`; restart worker; retry via `php artisan queue:retry all` |

# Phase-47 WIZARD-MIGRATE extensions (2026-05-17)

Phase 47 finishes the consumer migration Phase 46 laid the groundwork for. The
result: a single transactional write path, no JSON-blob duplication, role-aware
dispatch, and real nudge emails.

## OnboardingSessionService is now the only wizard write path

`OnboardingController::saveStep` routes every step write through
`OnboardingSessionService::advance($session, $nextStep, $writer)` (forward
progress) or `::writeAt($session, $writer)` (re-edit of a past step / final
step). Either way the writer runs inside a `DB::transaction` — a thrown writer
does not advance the session AND does not commit half-canonical state.

A new tiny interface `App\Services\Onboarding\OnboardingStepProcessor` formalises
the writer contract; `OnboardingService` (landlord — 8 steps),
`TenantOnboardingService` (3 steps), and `CaretakerOnboardingService` (3 steps)
all implement it. The controller resolves the right implementation from the
authenticated user's role.

## step_data is dead — remove on or after 2026-08-17

`OnboardingProgress.step_data` (JSON column) is the Phase 47 deprecation
target. `OnboardingService` no longer writes it; the 3 historical read callsites
(processStructure step 3 `property_id`, processStructure step 5 `default_rent`,
processFinancial step 5 `default_rent`) now read canonical rows
(`Property::latest('id')`, `PaymentConfiguration::value('default_rent')`).

`config('onboarding.mirror_exempt')` lists the column with `remove_at` of
**2026-08-17** (matching the kyc_completed_at retirement window). When the
column drops, also remove `saveStepData`/`getStepData` from
`OnboardingProgress` model.

## Nudge cron emails resume URLs via `OnboardingResumeMailable`

`onboarding:nudge-stalled` now dispatches `Mail::to($user->email)->queue(new
OnboardingResumeMailable($url, $session))`. The Mailable is
`ShouldQueue + afterCommit` so transaction rollbacks don't fire orphan emails.
`onboarding_nudge_mail_sent_count` gauge gives ops visibility (sample value, not
sev-paging).

Failure modes:
- **Queued but not delivered** → `php artisan queue:failed` + retry.
- **No queue worker** → cron writes the row to `last_nudge_sent_at` regardless,
  so the user is rate-limited at 24h. Fix the worker, then `queue:retry all`.
- **VAPID push** is a separate Phase-26 surface — the nudge cron only does
  email, not push.

## Role-aware wizard dispatch

`Pages/Onboarding/Index.vue` reads `auth.user.role` and dispatches:
- `tenant` → `TenantSteps.vue` (3 steps: profile, KYC ack, payment-method ack)
- `caretaker` → `CaretakerSteps.vue` (3 steps: profile, building-assignment ack,
  notification preferences)
- (default) → existing landlord 8-step branches

The tenant + caretaker scaffolds are intentionally minimal — Phase 48+ deepens
the UX, KYC integration, and per-building assignment ergonomics.

---

# Phase-48 TENANT-WIZARD-DEEP extensions (2026-05-17)

Phase 48 deepens Phase-47's acknowledgement-only tenant + caretaker scaffolds
into real functionality: KYC progress gate, persistent payment methods,
explicit caretaker accept/decline, per-type notification preferences, and a
polished wizard UI.

## Tenant KYC step deepening

`User::kycProgress()` is the new wizard-ready accessor. Returns
`{required, submitted, approved, pending, rejected, percent, remaining_labels}`.
Cached 5 minutes per user-id under `user:{id}:kyc-progress`; invalidates via
`TenantKycSubmission::saved` listener (also flushes
`user:{id}:kyc_verified_at` + `user:{id}:canonical_national_id` from Phase 46).

`TenantOnboardingService::processKyc` gates advance on
`progress.submitted >= progress.required` — a tenant must submit every
required document (pending review is acceptable) before the wizard cursor
moves forward. Actual document upload still lives at
`/complete-profile` (Phase 13 surface).

Inspect a tenant's progress: `php artisan tinker; User::find(N)->kycProgress();`

## Tenant payment-method storage

`tenant_payment_methods` table stores M-Pesa / bank / card credentials for
auto-debit. `details_encrypted` is auto-encrypted via Laravel's
`encrypted:json` cast — DPA-1 compliant. Single-default-per-(user, type)
invariant enforced by `App\Services\Tenant\TenantPaymentMethodService`.

Soft-deletes preserve the row for DPA-3 audit retention; right-to-be-forgotten
requests use `softDelete()` (not force-delete) so the audit trail stays.

The wizard step 3 is optional — supplying no `type` keeps the
acknowledgement-only path and still advances.

## Caretaker assignment workflow

`caretaker_assignments` (id, caretaker_id, building_id, status, assigned_at,
decided_at, decision_reason) is an append-only audit overlay on top of the
legacy `buildings.caretaker_id` single-FK link. `buildings.caretaker_id` stays
canonical for TicketObserver auto-assign behavior; the new table tracks the
workflow (pending → accepted | declined).

`RecordCaretakerAssignmentOnInvitationAccept` listener fires on
`InvitationAccepted` for caretaker invitations and mints pending
`CaretakerAssignment` rows for every building under the invitation's property.
The wizard step 2 walks these rows and flips them to accepted (default) or
declined based on form input. Decline clears `buildings.caretaker_id` so the
landlord knows to re-assign.

## Caretaker per-type notification preferences

`CaretakerOnboardingService::processNotificationPreferences` now writes both
channel toggles (email/sms/whatsapp/push) AND per-type columns from
`NotificationPreference::caretakerTypes()`: maintenance_notice_enabled,
general_enabled, caretaker_invitation_enabled, tenant_invitation_enabled,
lease_expiry_enabled.

Tenant-facing types (rent_reminder_enabled, invoice_enabled, etc.) stay at
their defaults — irrelevant for caretakers.

## Visual UX polish

`Pages/Onboarding/Components/WizardProgressBar.vue` is shared by TenantSteps +
CaretakerSteps and reads `currentStep` + `totalSteps` props. Both scaffolds
gained branded styling (gradient bg + rounded-2xl + ring shadows matching
landlord Index.vue palette), per-field `form.errors` display, flash error
display, and submit-button processing state.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Tenant blocked at wizard step 2 | Required KYC docs not submitted | Tenant uploads at `/complete-profile`; KYC `saved` listener invalidates cache |
| TenantPaymentMethod missing after wizard step 3 | Form sent no `type` (acknowledgement-only path) | Expected — supply `type` + `details` to persist |
| Caretaker sees 0 pending assignments | InvitationAccepted listener didn't fire | Check property_id on invitation; verify caretaker role; manually call `CaretakerAssignmentService::recordAssignment` |
| Caretaker preference matrix incomplete | Type column not in `caretakerTypes()` | Add the column name to the static array + migration if column is new |

## Phase 66 — In-app product tour (ONBOARDING-TOUR)

A server-authoritative, milestone-aware product tour that spotlights key nav items for new users. Engine: `App\Services\Onboarding\TourService` + `user_tour_states`; UI: `Components/Tour/TourOverlay.vue` (SVG-mask spotlight) + `TourTooltip.vue` (@floating-ui card).

### How it shows
- `HandleInertiaRequests` shares `auth.onboarding_tour` = `TourService::payloadFor($user)` on every authenticated request.
- The payload is `null` (tour hidden) when the role has no tour, the `user_tour_states` row is terminal (completed/dismissed), or milestone progress has filtered every step away.
- `TourOverlay.vue` is mounted once in `AuthenticatedLayout` and self-gates on that payload — no per-page wiring.

### Registry (data, not code)
Tours live in `TourService::REGISTRY`, one tour_key per role: `landlord-dashboard` (≤6 steps), `caretaker-intro` (3), `tenant-intro` (3). Each step has a `target` ([data-tour] anchor), optional `gate` (an `OnboardingMilestone` — the step is dropped once reached), and optional `route`. A new tour drops in as a registry entry + lang copy; no engine change.

### Milestone gating
A landlord step that teaches "add your first building" carries `gate => FIRST_PROPERTY` and is filtered out once that milestone fires — the tour only shows what the user hasn't done. The ungated `welcome` step always survives until the tour is finished.

### State + endpoints
`user_tour_states` (unique `user_id`+`tour_key`): `current_step` cursor, `status` (active/completed/dismissed — terminal), lifecycle timestamps. Endpoints are auth + `throttle:60,1`, with the tour_key derived from the role server-side (never client-sent):

| Route | Effect |
|---|---|
| `POST onboarding-tour.advance` `{step}` | monotonic cursor bump |
| `POST onboarding-tour.complete` | terminal |
| `POST onboarding-tour.dismiss` | terminal |

All three no-op once terminal, so a replayed request cannot resurrect a finished tour.

### Anchors
`[data-tour]` binds to nav items via `:data-tour="item.tour"`: `nav-dashboard`/`nav-buildings`/`nav-tenants`/`nav-finances` (landlord), `nav-tickets` (caretaker), `nav-tenant-finances`/`nav-inbox` (tenant). A missing anchor (e.g. collapsed on mobile) degrades to a centred tooltip — no crash.

### a11y / i18n
`role=dialog` + `aria-modal`, focus trap, Esc to skip, Arrow keys (RTL-inverted via `useRtlAware`), per-step screen-reader announce, mobile bottom-sheet, `prefers-reduced-motion` disables the spotlight animation. Copy in `lang/{en,sw}/onboarding.php` under `tour.*` (ar `[TODO-ar]`); `tour.step_of` uses vue-i18n `{curly}` params, guarded by `ClientI18nParamConventionTest`.

### Tests
`Phase66OnboardingTourTest` (gating, terminal-null, monotonic advance, reject-after-complete, endpoints, auth, validation) + `Phase66OnboardingTourSurfaceTest` (dependency + mount + anchors + registry + copy).

## Cross-references

- `docs/runbooks/alert-thresholds.md` — sev3/sev4 rows for `canonical_mirror_drift_count` + `onboarding_session_abandoned_count` + `tenant_kyc_blocked_count`
- `docs/runbooks/tenant.md` — Phase 45 [TENANT-DEPTH] including EMERGENCY-CONTACT-SMS-3 (the specific case Phase 46 generalises)
- `phase-46-audit-prd.json` — full PRD + audit_closeout
- `phase-47-audit-prd.json` — full PRD + audit_closeout
- `phase-48-audit-prd.json` — full PRD + audit_closeout

## Phase 77 [ONBOARDING-DEEP-2] (2026-05-21)

Closes onboarding's last parity gap: a deepened caretaker flow, an
invitation deep-link, and per-step + invite drop-off analytics.

### Caretaker flow (3 → 5 steps)

`OnboardingFlow::forRole('caretaker')` is now `[1=Welcome, 2=Profile,
3=Building assignment, 4=Notification preferences, 5=Orientation]` — welcome +
orientation bookends matching the landlord flow. `CaretakerOnboardingService`
handles them (welcome/orientation are no-op advances). `OnboardingController`
builds **per-role** caretaker step props (`caretakerStepProps`) instead of
borrowing the landlord `getStepProps`:
- Step 3 carries the pending assignments **with building stats** (units /
  occupied / open tickets) from `CaretakerBuildingSummaryService::forCaretaker`
  (landlord-scoped via `building.landlord_id`, batched — no N+1).
- Step 5 carries the building summary + `firstTaskUrl`.

`Onboarding/Index.vue` forwards the server-injected props
(totalSteps/pendingAssignments/buildingSummary/firstTaskUrl/profile) to
`CaretakerSteps.vue` via `$page.props` (the previous 2-prop forwarding silently
neutered the step-3 stats + the whole orientation step).

### First-task hand-off

`CaretakerFirstTaskResolver::resolve(user)` returns the oldest open ticket on an
**accepted** building (landlord-scoped), else `maintenance.hub`. Used by the
orientation step CTA AND the invitation deep-link. Caretaker onboarding
completion redirects here instead of the generic dashboard.

### Invitation deep-link

`InvitationController::accept` + `acceptAuthenticated` redirect a caretaker to
`onboarding.step(1)` (the `InvitationAccepted` event fires first so the pending
assignments exist). `store()` now sets `invitations.role = 'caretaker'` —
without it `RecordCaretakerAssignmentOnInvitationAccept` (gated on
`role === 'caretaker'`) was a production no-op. `invitations.viewed_at` is
stamped once on the first view (sent → opened funnel signal).

### Analytics

- `OnboardingFunnelService::forRole/all` — per-role per-step reached
  (`current_step >= step OR completed`) + completion_rate + biggest drop-off
  step, from `onboarding_sessions` (grouped counts, platform-wide).
- `InvitationFunnelService::platform/forLandlord` — sent / viewed / accepted /
  pending / expired + acceptance_rate over `invitations` + `tenant_invitations`.
- `/ops/onboarding/funnel` (super-admin) renders both.
- `onboarding:funnel-rollup` (daily 04:55 Africa/Nairobi) emits
  `onboarding_completion_rate{role}`, `onboarding_active_sessions_count{role}`,
  `onboarding_dropoff_step_number{role}`, `invitation_acceptance_rate`,
  `invitations_pending_count`; fires `onboarding_completion_low` (sev4) when a
  role with sample ≥ 10 drops below `config(onboarding.completion_rate_alert_pct)`.

### Incident playbook

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| `onboarding_completion_low` fires for a role | Drop-off at a step | Check `/ops/onboarding/funnel` `drop_off_step` for that role; inspect that step's form/validation |
| Caretaker step 3 shows no buildings | Invite created without `role='caretaker'` (pre-Phase-77) or assignments declined | Confirm `invitations.role`; re-issue the invite |
| Low `invitation_acceptance_rate` | Invites sent but not opened/accepted | Compare sent vs viewed on the invite funnel; nudge or resend |

### CI gates

- `Phase77CaretakerContextTest`, `Phase77CaretakerFlowTest`,
  `Phase77InviteDeeplinkTest`, `Phase77FunnelTest`
- `Phase77OnboardingDeep2SurfaceTest` — cross-category presence map
